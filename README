# Ignite feed

Small feed project, which allows you to insert comments into the post.

Project developed within the Rocketseat bootcamp.

Differentiating from this project, I set a personal challenge to cover 100% with the tests. I even used Huksy in combination with Jest to approve commits with 100% coverage.

**Main technologies used:**

- Typescript
- React
- Jest
- Testing-library
- Vite (3.1)
- Module css
- Eslint
- Linter staged
- Prettier
- Husky
